          Every series is sequenced like a magazine spreadâ€”anchored by a hero frame,
          supported by contextual notes, and paced with captions that read more like
          field annotations than social posts. Gear details sit alongside location
          stamps so the narrative and the technical decisions stay in dialogue.
