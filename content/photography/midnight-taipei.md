The series started as test shots for a typography reference—documenting how light wraps around Mandarin characters. It became an excuse to chase humidity, neon, and motion blur across Zhongzheng after midnight.

I let the camera rest at ISO 1600 and leaned into the grain. The deliberate slowness keeps headlamps trailing and pedestrians blurred, reinforcing how alive the city stays past closing hours.
