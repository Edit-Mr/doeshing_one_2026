## From Newsprint to Pixels

The newspaper aesthetic has always felt like homeâ€”structured, rhythmic, and bold. This redesign embraces sharp grids and generous white space to give long-form storytelling space to breathe.

### The Framework Stack

- **Next.js 15** handles the hybrid rendering for fast, reliable delivery.
- **Tailwind CSS** gives full control over the layout scales.
- **Prisma** keeps the content workflow consistent across Postgres and MDX sources.

> Great editorial design is choreography. Each block of content has a role to play.

## Designing for Motion

A publication breathes through subtle motion. Scroll-based parallax, offset grids, and accent color cues lead the reader from headline to tagline. The small touches build trust, one piece at a time.
