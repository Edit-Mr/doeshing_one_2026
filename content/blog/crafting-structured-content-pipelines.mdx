## A Two-Track Publishing Flow

Projects live as Markdown files, empowering long-form documentation with MDX-powered callouts. Meanwhile, quick news and updates flow through Prisma-managed posts, optimized for scheduling and tagging.

### Content Lifecycle

1. Draft in Notion or Obsidian
2. Convert to MDX with frontmatter
3. Publish via Git or the upcoming admin panel

The editorial workflow leans on automation without losing the handcrafted feel of a magazine.
