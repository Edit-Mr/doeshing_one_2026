## Why Go Static?

Static site generation with MDX files offers several advantages over database-driven content:

- **Performance**: No database queries needed at runtime
- **Version Control**: Content lives alongside your code in git
- **Simplicity**: Easy to backup, migrate, and manage
- **Developer Experience**: Write in your favorite editor with full IDE support

## The Migration Approach

Converting from Supabase/Prisma to static MDX involves three main steps:

### 1. Create the Content Structure

Organize your blog posts in a `content/blog` directory. You can use subdirectories for categorization:

```
content/
  blog/
    post-1.mdx
    post-2.mdx
    tutorials/
      tutorial-1.mdx
```

### 2. Update Data Loading Functions

Replace database queries with file system reads and MDX parsing. Use libraries like:
- `gray-matter` for frontmatter parsing
- `unified` for markdown rendering
- Next.js `unstable_cache` for performance

### 3. Maintain the Same Interface

Keep your existing components and page structure. The change is transparent to users.

## Benefits Realized

After migration, you'll enjoy:
- Faster build times
- No database dependencies
- Easier content collaboration via pull requests
- Better offline development experience
