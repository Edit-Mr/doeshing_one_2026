## Serif Meets Sans

Playfair Display brings the elegance. Inter keeps paragraphs legible. This mix mirrors the balance of large, attention-grabbing headlines and compact supporting stories you'd expect in a weekend edition.

- Drop caps signal feature reads.
- Tight letter spacing adds gravitas to headlines.
- Accent color rules guide the eye without overwhelming.

In short, thoughtful typography does the heavy lifting for tone and clarity.
