# Blog Content

This directory contains all blog posts in MDX format. Posts are automatically loaded and displayed on the website.

## File Structure

```
content/blog/
├── post-slug.mdx          # Individual post
├── another-post.mdx       # Another post
└── category-name/         # Subcategory (optional)
    └── post-in-category.mdx
```

## Creating a New Post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in this directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top of the file
3. Write your content in Markdown/MDX below the frontmatter

### Example Post

```mdx
---
title: "Your Post Title"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post that appears in listings"
coverImage: "/images/blog/cover.svg"
date: "2025-10-23"
author:
  name: "Your Name"
  avatar: "/images/avatar.svg"
  bio: "Your bio here"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
published: true
featured: false
featuredOrder: 1
---

## Frontmatter Fields

| `title` | string | Yes | Post title |
| `excerpt` | string | Yes | Brief description for listings and SEO |
| `coverImage` | string | No | Path to cover image |
| `showCoverImage` | boolean | No | Whether to display cover image in article (default: true) |

**Note:** The `category` field is automatically determined from the folder structure and should NOT be included in frontmatter.

## Categories/Subcategories

Categories are **automatically determined by the folder structure**. You don't need to specify them in frontmatter.

### Examples:

```
content/blog/
├── general-post.mdx           # No category (root level)
├── another-post.mdx           # No category (root level)
├── tutorials/                 # Category: "tutorials"
│   ├── getting-started.mdx    # Category: "tutorials"
│   ├── intermediate.mdx       # Category: "tutorials"
│   └── advanced/              # Category: "tutorials/advanced"
│       └── deep-dive.mdx      # Category: "tutorials/advanced"
└── guides/                    # Category: "guides"
    ├── setup.mdx              # Category: "guides"
    └── deployment/            # Category: "guides/deployment"
        └── vercel.mdx         # Category: "guides/deployment"
```

### Category Features:

- **Automatic Detection**: Categories are extracted from the file path
- **Nested Support**: You can create subcategories using nested folders (e.g., `tutorials/advanced/`)
- **URL Structure**: Categories appear in URLs as `/category/tutorials` or `/category/tutorials/advanced`
- **Filtering**: Parent categories show all posts in child categories (e.g., filtering by "tutorials" shows posts in "tutorials/advanced" too)

## Tags

Tags are automatically normalized to slugs. For example:
- "Next.js" → "nextjs"
- "TypeScript" → "typescript"
- "Design Systems" → "design-systems"

## Publishing

- Set `published: true` to make a post visible
- Set `published: false` to hide a post (draft mode)
- Posts are sorted by date (newest first)

## Featured Posts

- Set `featured: true` to show a post on the homepage
- Use `featuredOrder` to control the order (lower numbers appear first)
- If there aren't enough featured posts, the latest posts will be shown

## MDX Features

You can use all standard Markdown features plus:
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables
- Blockquotes
- Lists
- Headings (automatically get table of contents)

Example:

```mdx
## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
\`\`\`

> This is a quote

- List item 1
- List item 2
```
