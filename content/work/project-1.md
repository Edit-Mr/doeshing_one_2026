## Overview

Atlas is a living design system engineered for story-first publishing teams. It provides a coherent suite of layout primitives, accessibility-minded typography, and editorial workflows tailored for weekly release cadences.

## Objectives

- Craft a responsive grid that mirrors the rhythm of classic broadsheets.
- Provide MDX-powered content authoring with real-time previews.
- Ship a theming engine that unlocks seasonal refreshes without touching code.

## Highlights

> The project reduced layout iteration time from days to hours while keeping the handcrafted look-and-feel.

### Role

I led design engineering from discovery through launch:

- Conducted audits of print templates and translated them into reusable React components.
- Built a tokenized typography scale synchronized with Figma via design tokens.
- Integrated realtime preview pipelines using Next.js server components and Vercel Edge functions.

### Stack

| Layer | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Content | MDX, Prisma, PostgreSQL |
| Tooling | Turborepo, Storybook, GitHub Actions |

## Outcomes

- Increased publishing velocity by 45%.
- Enabled designers to stage experiments without developer assistance.
- Won the 2024 CSS Design Awards Special Kudos.

## Next Steps

- Expand component coverage for long-form investigative features.
- Introduce live collaboration cues within the writing interface.
